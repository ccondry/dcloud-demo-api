user -> dcloud PCCE instant demo -> ha-proxy -> dcloud-toolbox-sjc.cisco.com -> shared services toolbox UI

log in to toolbox UI pushes password change to the linked account in the demo LDAP


dcloud-collab/toolbox-ui and dcloud-collab/toolbox-api live on toolbox1 and toolbox2 VMs in shared services
dcloud-collab/demo-api expanded to receive requests like update LDAP password, create agent, provision phone
toolbox-api uses JWT with all requests to demo-api
branding will run demo-api (as today) plus cce-service, cucm-service, etc.
